/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

let AnalysisOfRequirements='This this the second step, it determinds the expectatons of the project and is critial to its success or failure.'
let Design ='The third step, in which, is how the project will be built and what it will look like.'
let Implementation =' this is the fourth step when the project is built and design is put into effect.'
let TestingAndIntegration='The fifth step in which, the project is overall tested for errors or bugs.'
let Maintain= 'The final step includes modifying and updating software after the delivery is complete.'
